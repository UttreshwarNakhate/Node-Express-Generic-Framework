##Use of commitlint utility
Commitlint is used to check commit messages in Node.js (or any Git) projects.
#Why we use Commitlint: 1. To make sure all commit messages follow the same style (like a rule). 2. Helps keep the Git history clean and easy to read. 3. Good for teams working together.

Example rule:

##ESLint Setup
--ESLint is a tool used in Node.js projects to maintain code quality and consistency. It analyzes code for syntax errors, stylistic issues, and potential bugs, helping developers adhere to coding standards and best practices. By enforcing rules defined in its configuration, ESLint ensures a uniform codebase, making it more readable, maintainable, and less prone to errors.

    --It can be customized with plugins and configurations to fit specific project needs, and it integrates well with code editors and build processes for real-time feedback and automated checks
