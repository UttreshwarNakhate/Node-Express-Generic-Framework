**Use of commitlint utility
Commitlint is used to check commit messages in Node.js (or any Git) projects.
    #Why we use Commitlint:
        1. To make sure all commit messages follow the same style (like a rule).
        2. Helps keep the Git history clean and easy to read.
        3. Good for teams working together.

Example rule:
        feat: add login button
        fix: correct typo in navbar
